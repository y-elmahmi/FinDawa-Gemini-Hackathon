> **"Bridging the gap between physical healthcare logistics and digital AI intelligence."**

## 📖 Overview

**FinDawa** is a next-generation "Phygital" (Physical + Digital) platform designed to revolutionize how patients access medication and how pharmacists manage supply chains in Morocco. 

Built specifically for the **Gemini 3 Global Hackathon**, FinDawa moves beyond simple chat interfaces to offer a comprehensive ecosystem that leverages **Multimodal AI** and **Advanced Reasoning** to solve real-world crises: drug shortages, late-night pharmacy access, and medication safety.

## ✨ Gemini 3 Integration (The AI Engine)

This project harnesses the power of the **Gemini 3 model family** to drive core functionalities, not just as a wrapper, but as the decision-making engine:

### 1. 📷 Multimodal Prescription Analysis (Vision + Text)
* **Feature:** Patients can snap a photo of a handwritten prescription.
* **Gemini Role:** The model parses complex handwriting (Vision), extracts medication names and dosages, converts them into structured JSON data, and instantly queries the inventory of nearby pharmacies.

### 2. 🧠 Medical Reasoning & Safety Layer
* **Feature:** Smart Reservation System.
* **Gemini Role:** Before a reservation is confirmed, Gemini analyzes the new prescription against the patient's digital health record (uploaded history) to **reason** about potential drug interactions or allergies, providing a safety warning to both patient and pharmacist.

### 3. 💬 Context-Aware AI Assistant (Darija Support)
* **Feature:** An interactive Chatbot embedded in the app.
* **Gemini Role:** It understands local context (Moroccan Darija/French dialect mix), helping users find on-duty pharmacies and explaining medical instructions in native language.
